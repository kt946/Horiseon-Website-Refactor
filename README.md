# Code Refactor Starter Code

For this challenge, I took an existing code for the Horiseon website and refactored it to follow accessibility standards and improve its SEO.

The head, body, and footer elements, as well as all the elements within them, needed indentations to differentiate where each content begins and ends. I have also included spacing and comments to make each section legible for developers.

I added a proper title for the webpage in the title element. I changed multiple div containers into proper semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, section, and footer. I have also removed several class attributes and modified their CSS declarations to select their elements instead of classes. I ensured that the navigation links worked properly by adding a missing id attribute in the "content" section.

For the "content" and "benefits" section, I changed several repetative CSS declarations by organizing selectors by their elements and removed the individual class attributes from the HTML.
I have also added alt attributes to each image in the "content" section to improve accessiblity. 

The following image depicts a screenshot of the completed website:
